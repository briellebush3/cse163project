# CSE 163 Project - Socioeconomic Status Score by Country

## Project Instructions
1. Run question_1.py to answer our first research question, what factors contribute the most to the socioeconomic status score of a country?
2. Run question_2.py to answer our second research question, how does education attainment contribute to the national development of a country via its GDP per capita?
3. Run question_3.py to answer our third research question, how have the top 5 countries with the highest socioeconomic score and the bottom 5 countries with the lowest socioeconomic score changed from 1910-2010?


## Project Set Up
You will need to install the following libraries to run our modules:
- import seaborn as sns
- import pandas as pd
- import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
- from scipy import stats

We used a supplementary dataset about education attainment which you can find here: https://databank.worldbank.org/source/education-statistics:-Education-Attainment# 

We customized the dataset for our research needs by including:
- All countries
- Filtering the data to just get data from 1970-2010
- Filtering the data type to just get total average years of primary school for ages 15+ and total average years of secondary school for ages 15+
